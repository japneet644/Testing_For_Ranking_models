# Testing_For_Ranking_models

Code for my research work on Testing for Ranking models.

## Experiments

This repository contains three folders, each corresponding to a different experiment:

### Synthetic Experiment 1

* Investigates the behavior of threshold for test T based on the empirical quantile approach for various values of n and k, and for different graph topologies and Thurstone models.
* See `synthetic_experiment_1/README.md` for more details.

### Synthetic Experiment 2

* Confidence intervals under null hypothesis for the BTL model.
* See `synthetic_experiment_2/README.md` for more details.

### Testing for LYMSYS

* Applies our test to the LMSYS chatbot leaderboard, a widely used benchmark for evaluating the performance of LLMs.
* See `testing_for_lymsys/README.md` for more details.

## Code Organization

Each folder contains the code for the corresponding experiment, along with associated README files providing more information on the experiment and how to run the code.
